In the previous steps we have added more and more functionality to the cart service and when we define our microservices it's often done using a domain model approach. The cart service is central, but we probably do not want it to handle things like calculating shipping fees. In our example we do not have enough data to do a complex shipping service since we lack information about the users shipping address as well as weight of the products etc. It does however make sense to create the shipping service so that if when we have that information we can extend upon it.

Since we are going to implement the Shipping service as another Vert.x Verticle we will not use REST this time. Instead we are going to use the Vert.x Event bus.

## The Event bus in Vert.x
The event bus is the nervous system of Vert.x.

The event bus allows different parts of your application to communicate with each other irrespective of what language they are written in, and whether they’re in the same Vert.x instance, or in a different Vert.x instance.

It can even be bridged to allow client side JavaScript running in a browser to communicate on the same event bus.

The event bus forms a distributed peer-to-peer messaging system spanning multiple server nodes and multiple browsers.

The event bus supports publish/subscribe, point to point, and request-response messaging.

The event bus API is very simple. It basically involves registering handlers, unregistering handlers and sending and publishing messages.

Internally the EventBus is an abstraction and Vert.x have several different implementations that can be used depending on demands. Default it uses a local java implementation that can't be shared between different java processes. However, for clustered solutions the event bus can use an distributed in-memory data store like Infinispan (also know as Red Hat JBoss Data Grid) or Hazelcast. There are also work in progress to be able to use a JMS implementation like Apache ActiveMQ (also known as Red Hat AMQ) 

>**NOTE:** In the near future RHOAR is planned to offer support for Red Hat JBoss Data Grid for clustering use-cases of Vert.x

## The Event bus API

Let's first discuss some Theory:

**Addressing**
Messages are sent on the event bus to an address.

Vert.x doesn’t bother with any fancy addressing schemes. In Vert.x an address is simply a string. Any string is valid. However it is wise to use some kind of scheme, e.g. using periods to demarcate a namespace.

Some examples of valid addresses are europe.news.feed1, acme.games.pacman, sausages, and X.

**Handlers**
Messages are received in handlers. You register a handler at an address.

Many different handlers can be registered at the same address.

A single handler can be registered at many different addresses.

**Publish / subscribe messaging**
The event bus supports publishing messages.

Messages are published to an address. Publishing means delivering the message to all handlers that are registered at that address.

This is the familiar publish/subscribe messaging pattern.

Point to point and Request-Response messaging
The event bus also supports point to point messaging.

Messages are sent to an address. Vert.x will then route it to just one of the handlers registered at that address.

If there is more than one handler registered at the address, one will be chosen using a non-strict round-robin algorithm.

With point to point messaging, an optional reply handler can be specified when sending the message.

When a message is received by a recipient, and has been handled, the recipient can optionally decide to reply to the message. If they do so the reply handler will be called.

When the reply is received back at the sender, it too can be replied to. This can be repeated ad-infinitum, and allows a dialog to be set-up between two different verticles.

This is a common messaging pattern called the request-response pattern. 

Let’s jump into the API

Getting the event bus
You get a reference to the event bus as follows:

```java
EventBus eb = vertx.eventBus();
```

There is a single instance of the event bus per Vert.x instance.

**Registering Handlers**
This simplest way to register a handler is using consumer. Here’s an example:

```java
EventBus eb = vertx.eventBus();

eb.consumer("news.uk.sport", message -> {
  System.out.println("I have received a message: " + message.body());
});
```

**Publishing messages**
Publishing a message is simple. Just use publish specifying the address to publish it to.

```java
eventBus.publish("news.uk.sport", "Yay! Someone kicked a ball");
```

**The Message object**
The object you receive in a message handler is a `Message`.

The body of the message corresponds to the object that was sent or published. The object has to be serializable, but it's recommended to use JSON encoded String as objects.

The headers of the message are available with headers.


**1. Add a Shipping Verticle**
Since RHOAR currently do not support using distributed event bus we will create the Verticle locally. For now our shipping service will only return a fixed ShippingFee of 37.0. RHOAR is planned to support distributes event bus early 2018. Since the Event Bus API is the same very little code changes (if any) will be required to move this to a separate service in OpenShift in the future.

<pre class="file" data-filename="./src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/ShippingServiceVerticle.java" data-target="replace">
package com.redhat.coolstore;

import io.vertx.core.AbstractVerticle;
import io.vertx.core.eventbus.EventBus;
import io.vertx.core.eventbus.MessageConsumer;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;
import io.vertx.core.logging.Logger;
import io.vertx.core.logging.LoggerFactory;

public class ShippingServiceVerticle extends AbstractVerticle {
    private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ShippingServiceVerticle.class.getName());

    @Override
    public void start() {
        logger.info("Starting " + this.getClass().getSimpleName());
        EventBus eb = vertx.eventBus();
        MessageConsumer&lt;String&gt; consumer = eb.consumer("shipping");
        consumer.handler(message -&gt; {
            logger.info("Shipping Service recieved a message");
            message.reply(new JsonObject().put("shippingFee", 37.0).encode()); //Hardcoded shipping Fee
        });
    }
}
</pre>

Done! That was easy. :-) We still have to update the shopping cart to use the Shipping service. Let's do that next.

**2. Update the Shopping cart to call the Shipping Service**
In the future we might want to base the shipping service on the actual content of the Shopping cart so it stands to reason that we call the shipping service every time someone updates the cart. In the training however we will only call the Shopping cart when someone adds a product to it. 

We will implement the shipping fee similary to how we implemented the `getProduct` that called out to the Catalog service. 

In the ``src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/CartServiceVerticle.java``{{open}} we will add the following method at the marker: `//TODO: Add method for getting the shipping fee`. Copy the content below or click on the CopyToEditor button.

//TODO: Add method for getting the shipping fee
<pre class="file" data-filename="./src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/CartServiceVerticle.java" data-target="insert" data-marker="//TODO: Add method for getting the shipping fee">
    private void getShippingFee(ShoppingCart cart, Handler&lt;AsyncResult&lt;Double&gt;&gt; resultHandler) {
        EventBus eb = vertx.eventBus();

        eb.send("shipping",
            Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart).encode(),
            reply -&gt; {
                if(reply.succeeded()) {
                    resultHandler.handle(Future.succeededFuture(new JsonObject(reply.result().body().toString()).getDouble("shippingFee")));
                } else {
                    resultHandler.handle(Future.failedFuture(reply.cause()));
                }
            });
    }
</pre>

Now, lets update the `addProduct` request handler method. Click to add:

<pre class="file" data-filename="./src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/CartServiceVerticle.java" data-target="insert" data-marker="sendCart(cart,rc); //TODO: update the shipping fee">
this.getShippingFee(cart, message -&gt; {
    if(message.succeeded()) {
        cart.setShippingTotal(message.result());
        sendCart(cart,rc);
    } else {
        sendError(rc);
    }

});
</pre>

Since we have the special case of product already exists we need to update it twice.  Click to add:

<pre class="file" data-filename="./src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/CartServiceVerticle.java" data-target="insert" data-marker="sendCart(cart,rc); //TODO: update the shipping fee, here as well">
this.getShippingFee(cart, message -&gt; {
    if(message.succeeded()) {
        cart.setShippingTotal(message.result());
        sendCart(cart,rc);
    } else {
        sendError(rc);
    }

});
</pre>

**3. Test our changes**

So now when we add something to the shopping cart it should also update the shipping fee and set it to 37.0

Firstly, build and start the cart service
``mvn compile vertx:run``{{execute T1 interrupt}}

Now issue a curl command to add a product that exists

```curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8082/services/cart/99999/329299/1 | grep -A7  "\"itemId\" : \"329299\"" | grep quantity```{{execute T3}}

Let's also make sure that it works with a totally new shopping cart, which would test the second part of our changes:

```curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8082/services/cart/99999/329299/1 | grep -A7  "\"itemId\" : \"329299\"" | grep quantity```{{execute T3}}

This should now return a shopping cart where one more instance of the product is added, because of our grep commands you would see something like this:

`"quantity" : 4`

The CartService depends on the CatalogService and just like in the Spring Boot example we could have created mocks for calling the Catalog Service, however since our example is already complex, we will simply test it with the CatalogService running.
