In this scenario you learned a bit more about what WildFly Swarm is, and how it can be used to create
modern Java microservice-oriented applications.

You created a new Inventory microservice representing functionality previously implmented in the monolithic
CoolStore application. For now this new microservice is completely disconnected from our monolith and is
not very useful on its own. In future steps you will link this and other microservices into the monolith to
begin the process of [strangling the monolith](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html).

WildFly Swarm brings in a number of concepts and APIs from the Java EE community, so your existing
Java EE skills can be re-used to bring your applications into the modern world of containers,
microservices and cloud deployments.

WildFly Swarm is one of many components of Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes. In the next scenario
you'll use Spring Boot, another popular framework, to implement additional microservices. Let's go!
