In this scenario you will see how easy it is to migrate from legacy platforms to JBoss EAP.
We'll answer questions like:

* Why move applications to OCP and cloud?
* What does the lift and shift process look like?

We will then take the following steps to migrate (lift & shift) an existing Java EE app to EAP+OpenShift using [Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhamt/overview/) (RHAMT)

* Analyze existing WebLogic monolith application using RHAMT.
* Review the report and update code and config to run on JBoss EAP
* Deploy to OpenShift
* Use OpenShift features like automatic clustering and failover to enhance the application

# What is Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit?

![Logo](/redhat-middleware-workshops/assets/moving-existing-apps/rhamt-logo.png)

Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit (RHAMT) is an extensible and customizable rule-based tool that helps simplify migration of Java applications.

It is used by organizations for:

* Planning and work estimation
* Identifying migration issues and providing solutions
* Detailed reporting
* Using built-in rules and migration paths
* Rule extension and customizability
* Ability to analyze source code or application archives

RHAMT examines application artifacts, including project source directories and application archives, then produces an HTML report that highlights areas needing changes. RHAMT can be used to migrate Java applications from previous versions of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or from other containers, such as Oracle® WebLogic Server or IBM® WebSphere® Application Server.

# How Does Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit Simplify Migration?

Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit looks for common resources and highlights technologies and known trouble spots when migrating applications. The goal is to provide a high-level view into the technologies used by the application and provide a detailed report organizations can use to estimate, document, and migrate enterprise applications to Java EE and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

> RHAMT is usually part of a much larger application migration and modernization program that involves well defined and repeatable phases over weeks or months and involves many people from a given business. Do not be fooled into thinking that every single
migration is a simple affair and takes an hour or less! To learn more about Red Hat's philosophy and proven methodology, check out
the [RHAMT documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-application-migration-toolkit) and contact your local Red Hat representative when embarking on a real world migration and modernization strategy.
