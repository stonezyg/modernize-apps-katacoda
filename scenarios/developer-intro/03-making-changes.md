In this step you will learn how to transfer files between your local machine and a running
container.

One of the properties of container images is that they are **immutable**. That is, although you can
make changes to the local container filesystem of a running image, the changes are _not permanent_.
When that container is stopped, _any changes are discarded_. When a new container is started from
the same container image, it _reverts back_ to what was originally built into the image.

Although any changes to the local container filesystem are discarded when the container is stopped,
it can sometimes be convenient to be able to upload files into a running container. One example of
where this might be done is during development and a dynamic scripting language like javascript or
static content files like html is being used. By being able to modify code in the container, you can modify the application to test
changes before rebuilding the image.

In addition to uploading files into a running container, you might also want to be able to download
files. During development these may be data files or log files created by the application.

## Copy files from container

As you recall from the last step, we can use `oc rsh` to execute commands inside the running pod.

For our Coolstore Monolith running with JBoss EAP, the application is installed in the `/opt/eap` directory in the running
container.

`oc rsh dc/coolstore ls -l /opt/eap`{{execute}}

You should see a listing of files in this directory **in the running container**.

> It is very important to remember where commands are executed! If you think you are in a container and in fact are on some other machine,
destructive commands may do real harm, so be careful! In general it is not a good idea to operate inside immutable containers outsode of the
development environment. But for doing testing and debugging it's OK.

Let's copy the EAP configuration in use so that we can inspect it. To copy files from a running container
on OpenShift, we'll use the `oc rsync` command. This command expects the name of the pod to copy from,
which can be seen with this command:

`oc get pods --selector deploymentconfig=coolstore --show-all=false`{{execute}}

The output should show you the name of the pod:

```console
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coolstore-2-bpkkc              1/1       Running   0          32m
```

The name of my running coolstore monolith pod is `coolstore-2-bpkkc` but yours will be different.

Save the name of the pod into an environment variable called `COOLSTORE_DEV_POD_NAME` so that we can use it for future
commands:

`export COOLSTORE_DEV_POD_NAME=$(oc get pods --selector deploymentconfig=coolstore -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.status.phase=="Running")].metadata.name}')`{{execute}}

Next, run the `oc rsync` command in your terminal window, using the new variable to refer to the name of the pod running our coolstore:

`oc rsync $COOLSTORE_DEV_POD_NAME:/opt/eap/standalone/configuration/standalone-openshift.xml /tmp`{{execute}}

The output will show that the file was downloaded:

```console
receiving incremental file list
standalone-openshift.xml

sent 30 bytes  received 31,253 bytes  62,566.00 bytes/sec
total size is 31,152  speedup is 1.00
```

Now you can open the file locally using this link: `/tmp/standalone-openshift.xml`{{open}} and inspect
its contents. This is useful for verifying that the contents of files in your applications are what you expect.

You can also upload files using the same `oc rsync` command but
unlike when copying from the container to the local machine, there is no form for copying a
single file. To copy selected files only, you will need to use the ``--exclude`` and ``--include`` options
to filter what is and isn't copied from a specified directory.

Manually copying is cool, but what about automatic live copying on change? That's in the next step!
