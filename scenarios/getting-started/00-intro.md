In this scenario you will get familiar with the environment in which you will work for the next day and get ready for the rest of
the Application Transformation Roadshow scenarios.

As modern application requirements become more complex, it’s apparent that one runtime, one
framework, or one architectural style is no longer a feasible strategy. Organizations must figure out how
to manage the complexity of distributed app development with diverse technologies, a lack of skilled
resources, and siloed processes.

In this hands-on workshop you’ll learn about:

* Migrating an existing legacy Java™ EE app to [Red Hat JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform](https://developers.redhat.com/products/eap/overview/) on [OpenShift](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview/).
* Using modern frameworks like [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Wildfly Swarm](http://wildfly-swarm.io),
[Eclipse Vert.x](http://vertx.io), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to implement microservices and
replace monolithic functionality.
* Developing and deploying using [Red Hat OpenShift Container
Platform](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview/), [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar/overview/), and
DevOps processes.
* The benefits and challenges with microservices, including use
cases for reactive microservices.
* Preventing and detecting issues in a distributed system.
* API gateways and microservices.

### The Environment

During this training course you will be using a hosted OpenShift environment that is created just for you.
This environment is not shared with other users of the system. **Your environment will only be active for
today**. As you progress
through the scenarios, your environment will remain the same, **as long as you use the same browser
session** (don't worry if your browser crashes or you accidentally close the browser tab, the persistence is
cookie-based and should survive).

The OpenShift environment that has been created for you is running the latest version of our open source
project called OpenShift Origin.  This deployment is a self contained environment that provides everything
you need to be successful in learning the platform.  This includes such things as the command line, web
console, and public URLs.

Now that you know how to interact with OpenShift, let's focus on some core concepts that you as a developer
will need to understand as you are building your applications!
