In this scenario you will get familiar with the environment in which you will work for the next day and get ready for the rest of
the Application Transformation Roadshow scenarios.

As modern application requirements become more complex, it’s apparent that one runtime, one
framework, or one architectural style is no longer a feasible strategy. Organizations must figure out how
to manage the complexity of distributed app development with diverse technologies, a lack of skilled
resources, and siloed processes.

In this hands-on workshop you’ll learn about:

* Migrating an existing legacy Java™ EE app to [Red Hat JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform](https://developers.redhat.com/products/eap/overview/) on [OpenShift](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview/).
* Using modern frameworks like [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Wildfly Swarm](http://wildfly-swarm.io),
[Eclipse Vert.x](http://vertx.io), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to implement microservices and
replace monolithic functionality.
* Developing and deploying using [Red Hat OpenShift Container
Platform](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview/), [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar/overview/), and
DevOps processes.
* The benefits and challenges with microservices, including use
cases for reactive microservices.
* Preventing and detecting issues in a distributed system.
* API gateways and microservices.
