In this scenario you learned how to use the OpenShift Container Platform as a developer to build,
deploy, and debug applications. You also learned how OpenShift makes your life easier as a developer,
architect, and DevOps engineer.

You can use these techniques in future projects to modernize your existing applications and add
a lot of functionality without major re-writes.

The monolithic application we've been using so far works great, but is starting to show its age.
Even small changes to one part of the app require many teams to be involved in the push to production.

In the next few scenarios we'll start to modernize our application and begin to move away from
monolithic architectures and toward microservice-style architectures using Red Hat technology. Let's go!
